## Major/New Features

## Upgrade

### Update Gemfile

```ruby
gem 'spree', '~> 3.4.0'
gem 'spree_auth_devise', '~> 3.3'
gem 'spree_gateway', '~> 3.3'
```

### Update your extensions

We're changing how extensions dependencies work. Previously you had to match
extension branch to Spree branch. Starting from Spree 3.2 release `master` branch of all
`spree-contrib` extensions should work with Spree >= `3.1` and < `4.0`. Please change
your extensions in Gemfile eg.:

from:

```ruby
gem 'spree_braintree_vzero', github: 'spree-contrib/spree_braintree_vzero', branch: '3-1-stable'
```

to:

```ruby
gem 'spree_braintree_vzero', github: 'spree-contrib/spree_braintree_vzero'
```

### Run `bundle update`

### Install missing migrations

```bash
rails spree:install:migrations
rails spree_auth:install:migrations
rails spree_gateway:install:migrations
```

### Run migrations

```bash
rails db:migrate
```

### Other Gotchas
